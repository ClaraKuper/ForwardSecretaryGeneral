[1] After World War II , Bahrain became the centre for British administration of the lower Persian Gulf . In 1968, when the British Government announced its decision to end the treaty relationships with the Persian Gulf sheikdoms, Bahrain joined with Qatar and the seven Trucial States (which now form the United Arab Emirates ) under British protection in an effort to form a union of Arab emirates. By mid-1971, however, the nine sheikhdoms still had not agreed on the terms of union. Accordingly, Bahrain sought independence as a separate entity declaring independence on August 15, 1971, and becoming formally independent as the State of Bahrain on December 16, 1971.

(1977), 421 (1977), 473 (1980) and 558 (1984), the Council strengthened the mandatory arms embargo against apartheid South Africa imposed by Resolution 418, and made it more comprehensive. Resolution 591 sought to clarify vague terms from previous resolutions on the topic. [1] The Council recognised the struggle of the South African people, calling for the establishment of a democratic state with full civil and political rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). It also condemned the "" racist regime"" in South Africa for its repression against opponents of apartheid, killing demonstrators, holding of political prisoners and defiance of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The resolution urged Member States to ensure that components of embargoed items did not reach South Africa through third countries, including spare parts for aircraft and other military equipment belonging to South Africa, and any items which other countries may feel are destined for use by the South African police force or military. Items included aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, electronic and telecommunications equipment, computers and four-wheel drive vehicles. In terms of ""arms and related material"" from Resolution 418, this included nuclear , strategic and conventional weapons , all military and paramilitary police vehicles and equipment and other related material. The Council urged particularly against any cooperation in the nuclear field. The Council then went on to urge Member States to not receive any imports of arms, ammunition or military vehicles from South Africa, asking those that had not yet done so to put an end to all exchanges and visits, including by government personnel. It also requested Member States, and those who are not a member of the United Nations, to not participate in any activities in the country that may contribute to South Africa's military capability, ensuring national legislation should reflect this. However though they did not agree with apartheid policies some states still cooperated with South Africa; Israel and the military government of Chile provided arms and Paraguay acted as a third country which goods were delivered. [2] Also, as many UN member states observed the resolution, non-member states and territories, including Taiwan , saw a rising share of its companies operating in South Africa, though it did not necessarily provide weaponry, due to pressure from other states. [2] Finally, Resolution 591 called on the Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to report on the progress of the implementation of the current resolution by no later than 30 June 1987. Though the resolution was adopted unanimously, its rulings were voluntary. The sanctions were lifted under Resolution 919 in 1994.

This was the second resolution by the Security Council over the invasion of Kuwait . The Council therefore decided that states should prevent: (a) the import of all products and commodities originating in Iraq or Kuwait; (b) any activities by their nationals or in their territories that would promote the export of products originating in Iraq or Kuwait, as well as the transfer of funds to either country for the purposes of such activities; (c) the sale of weapons or other military equipment to Iraq and Kuwait, excluding humanitarian aid ; (d) the availability of funds or other financial or economic resources to either country, or to any commercial, industrial or public utility operating within them, except for medical or humanitarian purposes.

The Council had been considering the question of Cambodia and the occupation of the country by Vietnamese troops for almost a decade, however, the Council could not act due to lack of agreement amongst its permanent members . Instead, it was addressed by the General Assembly . [1] After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Vietnam installed a puppet government , which was opposed by several groups in the country, including the United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia , Khmer People's Liberation Front and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea , but supported by both Vietnam and the Soviet Union . Representatives from each party gathered for the Paris Conference in 1989, but an agreement was not reached. After the Fall of Nations , the September 1990 Sino-Vietnamese Chengdu Conference [ vi ] favored the Beijing-proposed 13 members dialogue [2] instead of the Hanoi-proposed 12 members dialogue solution. [3] Following discussions in Indonesia and Japan in October 1990, the parties agreed a plan in which they would be guided by certain principles in order to solve the Cambodian problem.

The Council began by commending the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and reaffirmed the Yamoussoukro IV Accord, signed on 30 October 1991 as the best possible framework for a peaceful resolution of the Liberian conflict. The Accord provided for a Transitional Government with legislative, executive and judicial branches as well as allowing presidential elections to take place within seven months of the agreement being signed. [1] The resolution then condemned a violation of the ceasefire on 28 November 1990 and attacks on the ECOWAS Monitoring Group in Liberia, calling upon all parties to respect international law and implement the relevant agreements. It also requested the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send a Special Representative to Liberia to assess the situation, reporting to the Council with any recommendations. Then, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , the Council decided that all states should immediately implement a general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia until the Security Council decided otherwise. [2] The embargo however, would not apply to weapons and military equipment destined for the ECOWAS peacekeeping forces, and subsequently it was violated and exacerbated the conflict. [3] Finally, the Council commended the work of international humanitarian organisations and Member States in providing humanitarian aid to the population.

The Azerbaijani government complained of being treated like ""the defeated side.

[1] The Security Council noted the strong improvement of the situation in most regions of Somalia by UNOSOM II, acknowledging that the Somali people themselves were responsible for the reconciliation and reconstruction of their country, the highest priority for UNOSOM II, but stressed that the international community wanted to assist in the process. The General Agreement signed on 8 January 1993 in Addis Ababa and the Addis Ababa Agreement of the Conference on National Reconciliation on 27 March, for the Council, provided a solid basis for a solution. In that context, disarmament was crucial to peace and stability, though the Council condemned the continuing violence and attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers and the situation as a whole remained a threat to peace and security in the region. [2] The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report to the Security Council by 15 January 1994 on developments and an updated plan with the future strategy of the mission, with the Council deciding to undertake a review of the UNOSOM II mission by 1 February 1994 after receiving the report. All parties, factions and movements in Somalia were called to abide by the ceasefire and disarmament agreements and accelerate their efforts to achieve political reconciliation. It was important in this regard that concrete goals had to be achieved, including the creation of district and regional councils and an interim national authority. Additionally, the establishment of an operational police and legal system was important to this process. The parties were reminded that the further involvement of the United Nations depended on their co-operation to find a solution. The diplomatic efforts of the Member States and international organisations to include all factions to the negotiating table was praised. The Council reaffirmed that all countries should continue to observe the arms embargo against Somalia imposed in Resolution 733 (1992) while expressing concern at the destabilising effects of cross-border arms flows in the region in relation to the security of other countries. The Council stressed the link between rehabilitation and reconciliation, and encouraged donors to continue contributing to rehabilitation projects in areas where security and reconciliation were brought about. States were also encouraged to provide more troops, equipment, money to the process of national reconciliation in Somalia and asked for support to strengthen UNOSUM II.

[1] The Council noted that more efforts would be needed, including by the Economic Community of West African States , to advance the peace process. There was still no State Council installed and no ceasefire was in force. Concern was expressed at inter- and intra-factional fighting in parts of Liberia which had a detrimental effect on the civilian population and the efforts of humanitarian agencies to provide relief. The parties were urged to respect international humanitarian law and human rights. There were continued violations of the arms embargo imposed in Resolution 788 (1992). The Security Council stressed that further support from the international community for the peace process would depend on actions by the Liberian parties to resolve the conflict peacefully. By extending the mandate of UNOMIL until 15 September 1995 the Council expected the parties to use this time to make substantial progress towards the implementation of various agreements, and specifically to: [2] (a) install at State Council; (b) restore a ceasefire; (c) disengage all forces; (d) create a timetable for the implementation of aspects of the peace agreements. If the steps were not put into effect by 15 September, the mandate of UNOMIL would not be extended, however if they were, it would be enhanced. The parties in Liberia were called upon to respect the status of personnel from UNOMIL and the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) peacekeeping force and allow access to humanitarian aid to the population. Greater efforts were urged by the international community, including contributions to a fund to provide assistance, political efforts by the Organisation of African Unity and co-operation between UNOMIL and ECOMOG.

[1] The Security Council was concerned that suspicion and a lack of trust among the parties had contributed to the delay in implementing the United Nations plan for Western Sahara. For progress to be achieved, both parties would have to have a vision of the post- referendum period. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had set targets on assessing the Settlement Plan, including the release of political prisoners , confinement of Polisario troops and the reduction of Moroccan troops in the territory. The resolution reiterated the commitment of the council to hold a referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. [2] However, concern was expressed at the continued delays in implementing the plan for the referendum, as part of the overall Settlement Plan; all parties were urged not to impede the implementation of the Settlement Plan and requested the Secretary-General to persuade both Morocco and the Polisario Front to resume participation in its implementation. Boutros-Ghali was further requested by 10 September 1995 to report on progress in this area. It was expected that the referendum would take place in early 1996 with November 1995 as the beginning of the transitional period. Based on a further report from the Secretary-General, it would be decided whether to continue the mandate of MINURSO beyond 30 September 1995.

The resolution was passed during the Srebrenica massacre . [1] After reaffirming the sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Security Council expressed deep concern at the situation in Srebrenica and for the civilian population there. The situation proved challenging for UNPROFOR, particularly as there were many displaced persons at Potočari without essential humanitarian supplies . The detention of UNPROFOR personnel and attacks on the peacekeeping force by Bosnian Serb forces were condemned. The Council demanded that Bosnian Serb forces cease their offensive and withdraw from Srebrenica immediately, adding that the forces should respect its status as a safe area. [2] It also demanded that the safety of UNPROFOR personnel was ensured and for the release of some of its members under detention. This was addressed again in Resolution 1010 .

[1] The Security Council supported the role of UNMIH in assisting the Government of Haiti to achieve a secure and stable environment in the country. It was crucial that free and fair presidential elections took place. Efforts to establish a police force by UNMIH were praised, while UNMIH's mandate as a whole was being closely monitored by the council. UNMIH and the International Civilian Mission (MICIVIH) were thanked for their contributions during the legislative elections on 25 June 1995, though there were serious concern over irregularities in the conduct of the first round of the elections.

[2] The Council noted that the peace process in Angola had entered a new a promising phase with growing trust between the two parties; it was calm in most areas of the country though there were still a number of ceasefire violations. Human rights monitors and the deployment of United Nations military and police monitors had contributed significantly to the security situation in the country. [3] The commitment of both parties was commended but there was concern about the slow implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, and especially the dissolution of the troops, demining and the establishment of quartering areas. The importance of the electoral process was stressed and called for both parties to establish a timetable for the formation of new army , a prisoner of war exchange and repatriation of mercenaries . The two parties were urged to put an end to the laying of land mines and to report unauthorised troop movements.

Concern was expressed at violence by unaffiliated groups and called for measures to disarm them. The parties were called upon to allow access to all military facilities by UNAVEM III, and the Angolan government and UNITA also had to ensure that relief supplies could travel freely throughout the country.

[1] The Council stated that Croatia had not complied with the requirements of the Security Council which were made earlier in the month. Concern was expressed about the violations of the arms embargo and regretted that talks in Geneva had been broken off. The importance of a negotiated settlement was stressed in conjunction with mutual recognition of states in the former Yugoslavia . The large-scale offensive that Croatia began against ethnic Serbs on 4 August escalated the conflict and was regrettable. The shelling of civilian targets was again condemned, and it was noted that violations of international humanitarian law had been committed and that the people who fled were in a serious situation.

Possession of arms among the population was a major destabilising factor in the Great Lakes region . Zaire had proposed an international commission under the auspices of the United Nations to investigate arms supplies to former Rwandan government forces. The registration and marking of weapons would do much to control and enforce restrictions. There was concern regarding incursions into Rwanda by elements of the former regime and underlining the need for effective measures to ensure that Rwandan nationals in neighbouring countries could not undertake activities or receive weapons in order to destabilise the country. All sections of the Rwandan population, except those involved in genocide , had to begin talks. Rwanda demanded that the arms embargo against the Rwandan government be lifted to ensure the security of its people. [2] It was originally recalled that the arms embargo was in place to prevent the use of weapons and equipment in the massacres of innocent people. There had already decided to reduce the size of UNAMIR and that the Rwandan government was responsible for the safety of the population. The Council drew attention to Rwanda's legal system , particularly overcrowding, lack of judges, the detention of minors and the elderly and the lack of a quick judicial process. In this regard, efforts by the United Nations and donors in collaboration with Rwanda to improve the situation were welcomed. The Secretary-General was requested as soon as possible to make recommendations on a commission to conduct an investigation into the arms flows to former Rwandan government forces in the Great Lakes region. At the same time, Rwanda and its neighbours were asked to co-operate with the commission. Within a month, Boutros-Ghali was to report on preparations for convening a regional Conference on Security, Stability and Development and the repatriation of refugees . The Rwandan government was called upon to create an atmosphere of trust and confidence for the safe return of refugees and resolve humanitarian problems in its prisons.

[2] There was also a new State Council, a ceasefire in place, the beginning of the disengagement of forces and a timetable for the implementation of various aspects of the agreement. It was noted that, with the signing of the Abuja Accord, that additional troops from the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and further equipment and logistic support would also be required to ensure its deployment throughout the entire country.

[1] Despite the arms embargo, a number of violations were still reported with arms and materiel being sold to former Rwandan government forces. An inquiry had concluded its investigation, but it was noted that some countries had not fully co-operated with the investigation. The committee had concluded that Rwandan elements had received military training for the purposes of conducting destabilising raids into Rwanda, and there was strong evidence that arms deliveries had taken place. In one instance, there was a sale of weapons from the Seychelles in June 1994 and two subsequent shipments to Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo destined for Rwandan government forces. Aircraft were still continuing to land at Goma and Bukavu with arms for former Rwandan government forces and senior figures in those forces were raising funds for an armed struggle against Rwanda. These and continuing allegations had not been thoroughly investigated. Finally, radio broadcasts which spread hate and fear in the region needed to be terminated. The ban on arms supplies to Rwandan government forces had not been effectively implemented. The countries in the Great Lakes region were asked to ensure that their territory was not used as a base for incursions or providing weapons into Rwanda.

The need for all parties to provide security to UNAVEM III, to respect human rights and ensure the demilitarisation of Angolan society was emphasised after the deaths of two UNAVEM III personnel on 3 April 1996.

[1] The violence in Liberia had escalated in violation of the Abuja Agreement , and the Security Council stressed the importance of the capital Monrovia as a safe zone. The observance of the ceasefire had ended and hostilities were resumed, including in the capital. While the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) had deployed more troops in the city, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had adopted a mechanism for the resumption of the implementation of the Abuja Accord. The security council extended the mandate of the UNOMIL observation force in Liberia until 31 August 1996, and due to the deteriorating security situation, its size was temporarily downsized on the orders of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali . All attacks against ECOMOG (the ECOWAS peacekeeping force), UNOMIL and the humanitarian relief agencies, as well as the looting of their property was condemned. The parties were invited to abide by their agreements, observing the ceasefire and withdrawing from Monrovia. All countries were reminded to observe the arms embargo against Liberia imposed in Resolution 788 (1992) and report violations to the committee established in Resolution 985 (1995).

The resolution also stressed the unacceptability of hostile acts on the border with Afghanistan . The parties were called to end hostilities and comply with the Tehran Agreement, strongly urging the extension of a ceasefire during the inter-Tajik talks. UNMOT's mandate was extended until 15 December 1996 on the condition that the Tehran Agreement and the ceasefire remained in force.

After extending the mandate of UNFICYP, the Council welcomed the appointment of Han Sung-Joo as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Cyprus. It deplored the incident on 3 June 1996 in which a Greek Cypriot guard was killed in the buffer zone and Turkish Cypriot soldiers prevented UNFICYP troops from assisting the guard and to investigate the incident. Concern was also expressed at buildup of military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus, and tension was also increasing over military training flights.

Progress had been made recently, but the overall pace of implementation was slow. Talks on the formation of an army unit had been successfully completed and there was also an agreement on forming a unity government . Respect for human rights and the demilitarisation of Angolan society was important and the recovery of the Angolan economy was essential for lasting peace. [2] The two parties were praised for the military framework agreement and the beginning of the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan army . They had also worked on the removal of checkpoints, the re-opening of major roads and the quartering of 52,000 UNITA troops, which were all welcomed by the council. UNITA was requested to transfer its arms and ammunition to UNAVEM III. The Angolan government had also promulgated an amnesty law and a civilian disarmament program had started. There was a reduction in hostile propaganda and all parties were reminded to cease disseminating such information.

[1] On 2 October 1996 there was a summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) on politics, defense and security held in the Angolan capital Luanda . A delegation of SADC had also participated in the Security Council's deliberations on Angola. It was important that all parties adhered to the peace plans in Angola, including the Lusaka Protocol , respect human rights and the presence of the United Nations to implement the agreements. Concern was expressed at the lack of progress in the peace process over the past three months. Delays in the demobilisation of UNITA troops meant the process was behind schedule, making progress even more difficult during the rainy season . The delays, particularly by UNITA, were unacceptable for the council. However positive steps included the arrival of UNITA generals for service in the unified army, the quartering of 63,000 troops, the surrender of heavy weapons, selection of 10,000 UNITA troops for the unified army, the beginning of the demobilisation of underaged personnel and UNITA's proposal regarding the special status of its leader. The Security Council was disappointed that UNITA had failed to comply with its obligations and called on the group to immediately accomplish the following tasks: [2] (a) to complete the selection of 26,300 soldiers to be incorporated into the Angolan Armed Forces ; (b) to stem the flow of deserters from quartering areas and return those who have deserted; (c) to register UNITA policeman; (d) to dismantle all UNITA command posts; (e) to formally declare that all UNITA soldiers were quartered and that UNITA no longer had weapons; (f) to contribute to the extension of state administration throughout Angola and co-operate with UNAVEM III; (g) to make other generals and officers available to the military unit; (h) to return all elected members of the National Assembly; (i) to refrain from hindering demining activities and United Nations flights; (j) to co-operate with the Government of Angola and to make its radio station independent and non- partisan ; (k) to complete training of UNITA personnel which would protect UNITA officials; (l) to allow the free movement of goods and people. Unless these tasks were fulfilled, the council would consider imposing measures from Resolution 864 (1993). [3] The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 's intention to reduce the size of UNAVEM III by the end of December 1996 in accordance with Resolution 976 (1995) was noted, which also recommended that the mandate of UNAVEM III end by February 1997.

All parties in the country were asked to resolve their disputes by peaceful means, and the Council stressed the importance of non-interference in the internal affairs of the country, including flows of weapons into Afghanistan. It was convinced that the United Nations would continue to play a central role in international efforts to bring about a political settlement to the conflict. All Afghan parties were called upon to cease hostilities immediately and to start a political dialogue, as they themselves were responsible for a political solution. Meanwhile, all other countries were asked to refrain from interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs, respect its territorial integrity , sovereignty and independence and respect the right of the Afghan people to determine their own destiny. The countries were also urged to end the supply of arms and ammunition to all Afghan parties. [2] The resolution reiterated that the conflict in Afghanistan was an ideal breeding ground for terrorism and drug trafficking which could destabilise the region and therefore the parties were called upon to stop such activities.

[1] The security council recalled that it would take action against UNITA if it did not comply with its obligations under the Accordos de Paz, Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 1118 (1997). It demanded that UNITA and the Government of Angola immediately complete the remaining aspects of the peace process and refrain from actions that would increase tension. [2] UNITA was also required to demilitarise its troops, complete the transformation of its radio station Vorgan into a non- partisan broadcasting station, and extend the authority of the state to the areas controlled by it. It also had to immediately correct and complete information about the strength of its forces and provide the information to the Joint Commission. Acting under Chapter VII, all countries were then asked to adopt the following measures: [3] (a) prevent UNITA officials and their immediate families from entering their territory, except on occasions necessary for the functioning of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation, the National Assembly , or the Joint Commission; (b) cancel all travel documents, visas and residence permits to UNITA officials and their immediate families; (c) close all UNITA offices in their territory; (d) ban flights from landing, departing or overflying their territory; (e) ban the supply of aircraft parts; (f) ban the provision of insurance to Angolan aircraft, with exceptions noted in Resolution 864 (1993).

The council further demanded that Angola and UNITA continue to co-operate with the United Nations Mission in Angola (MONUA) and cease restricting its activities and laying land mines . It supported the recommendation of the Secretary-General for the withdrawal of United Nations military units to be suspended until end of October 1997. Finally, it was thought that a summit meeting between the President of Angola José Eduardo dos Santos and the leader of UNITA Jonas Savimbi could reduce the tension.

It was noted that the implementation of the General Agreement would require the effort of all parties and the support of the United Nations and the international community , particularly as the situation in Tajikistan remained volatile.

[1] On 8 June 1997, the security council extended the Oil-for-Food Programme in Iraq for an additional 180 days. It noted the Iraqi government's decision not to export petroleum or petroleum products from 8 June and 13 August 1997, and was therefore concerned at the resulting humanitarian effects on the Iraqi people due to a shortfall in revenue from oil sales. The council was determined to avoid any further deterioration in the humanitarian situation. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , countries were authorised to import oil and oil products from Iraq for 120 days from 8 June, not exceeding a total of one billion United States dollars. From 4 October 1997, there would be a period of 60 days in which further imports were authorised, not exceeding one billion United States dollars.

[1] The security council recalled that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) had strengthened its mission in Croatia to include the two-way return of refugees and displaced persons and a focus on the protection of their human rights. At the same time, Croatia had requested a continued presence of United Nations civilian police monitors following the termination of the mandate of UNTAES. The Croatian government was reminded of its obligations to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, underlining that the government, police and judicial authorities bore responsibility for this. It was also urged to fulfill its commitments, including those reached with UNTAES. The council also reiterated the right of refugees to return to their homes and welcomed progress made by the Croatian government in this regard, further calling for the removal of legal obstacles and other impediments to two-way returns. At the same time, the local Serb community was reminded of adopting a constructive attitude towards integration with the rest of Croatia. The security council created, with effect from 16 January 1998, a support group of 180 police observers for a single period of nine months to oversee the police in the Danube region in the northeast of Croatia near the border with Serbia and Montenegro .

There was also concern about the strengthening of military weapons in southern Cyprus and the lack of progress in decreasing the number of foreign troops. In this regard, the Council urged the Republic of Cyprus to cut back on defence spending and withdraw foreign troops, with an overall view to demilitarising the entire island.

[1] The Government of Cyprus had again agreed to the continued presence of UNFICYP on the island. The situation along the ceasefire line had remained calm apart from minor violations, though there were restrictions upon UNFICYP's freedom of movement . The mandate of UNFICYP was extended until 15 December 1999 and authorities in Cyprus and Northern Cyprus were reminded to ensure the safety of UNFICYP personnel and end violence against it. Military authorities on both sides were urged to refrain from actions that could exacerbate tensions such as demining along the Buffer Zone . The Greek Cypriot side in particular was called upon to implement the UNFICYP package of measures. There was also concern about the strengthening of military weapons in southern Cyprus and the lack of progress in decreasing the number of foreign troops. In this regard, the Council urged the Republic of Cyprus to cut back on defence spending and withdraw foreign troops, with an overall view to demilitarising the entire island. The security council welcomed the ongoing efforts of UNFICYP to implement its humanitarian mandate. It also reaffirmed its long-standing position that the Cyprus issue should be resolved on the basis of a single Cyprus with a bi-zonal and bi-communal federation without secession or union with another country.

[1] The Security Council recalled a request upon Member States to end arms sales to Ethiopia and Eritrea in Resolution 1227. It deplored the ongoing fighting between the two countries and expressed regret that all resources in those countries was diverted towards the conflict which had a negative effect on efforts to address the ongoing food crisis. There was need for a peaceful solution and initial discussions under the auspicies of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) had just ended. At the same time the Council determined the situation to be a threat to peace and security in the region. [2] Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , the fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea was strongly condemned and the Security Council demanded that both parties retreated and resumed talks as soon as possible. All countries were prevented from selling arms , ammunition and all related technical assistance or training to  Eritrea and Ethiopia. [3] Only non-lethal military equipment for humanitarian use was excluded from the arms embargo. A Committee of the Security Council was established to monitor compliance with the embargo , enhance its effectiveness, investigate violations and determine cases to be excluded from its provisions. All countries had to report within 30 days regarding what steps they had taken to implement the measures, which would apply for a period of 12 months. Finally, the Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to report within 15 days and every 60 days thereafter on the implementation of the current resolution. The Council declared that the embargo would be terminated if a peaceful settlement of the conflict had been concluded.

The Council supported efforts by MINURSO to implement the Settlement Plan and agreements to hold a free and fair referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara. Fundamental differences between Morocco and the Polisario Front had yet to be resolved. MINURSO's mandate was extended on the condition that both parties would submit proposals to be agreed upon in order to resolve problems relating to the implementation of the Settlement Plan and an overall durable solution concerning the political status of Western Sahara.

[1] The Security Council was convinced of the need for a temporary measure to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people until the Iraqi government fulfilled the provisions of Resolution 687 (1991) and had distributed aid throughout the country equally. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter , the Council extended the Oil-for-Food Programme for an additional six-month period beginning at 00:01 EST on 9 June 2000 and ending on 5 December 2000.

Up to US$600 million also produced in the escrow account could be used to meet reasonable expenses other than those payable to Iraq. The resolution, drafted by France and the United Kingdom, [3] called upon all states to continue to co-operate in the prompt submission of applications and issue of export licences which would facilitate the transit of humanitarian supplies. It also appealed to countries to take all appropriate measures to ensure that humanitarian supplies reached the Iraqi people as soon as possible. An attempt by China and Russia to write into the resolution language that would have identified the United Nations sanctions as the sole cause of the situation in Iraq was defeated as Council members were informed that Iraq had made US$8.6 billion profit from oil sales in the previous six months.

It welcomed the opening of the crossing points between Croatia and Montenegro facilitating civilian and commercial traffic without security incidents that represented a significant confidence-building measure between the two countries. There was still concern at the lack of progress towards a settlement of the disputed Prevlaka peninsula issue and a demining programme. Both Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) were urged to fully implement an agreement on the normalisation of their relations, cease violations of the demilitarisation regime, reduce tension and to ensure freedom of movement to United Nations observers. The Council remained concerned at the lack of progress in implementing confidence-building measures. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was asked to report by 15 October 2000 on recommendations for confidence-building measures between the two parties. The parties were urged to report on the progress of their bilateral negotiations at least twice a month.

[1] The Security Council remained concerned by the threat that piracy and armed robbery against vessels posed to the situation in Somalia , nearby states and international shipping. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was also reaffirmed as was the need to address problems caused by the limited capacity of the judicial system in Somalia and neighbouring states to effectively prosecute those suspected of being involved in piracy.

The resolution welcomed efforts by the European Union , NATO and other states acting in a national capacity for their efforts to suppress acts of piracy in co-operation with the Transitional Federal Government off the coast of Somalia. The efforts of Kenya, the Seychelles and other states were praised following the prosecution of pirates in their countries, consistent with international humanitarian law . There was concern that some suspected pirates had been released without facing justice , due to uncertainty over who could prosecute them. [2] In the second part of the resolution, sponsored by Russia , [3] the Council reiterated that the failure to prosecute those responsible for acts of piracy undermined anti-piracy efforts by the international community . Countries were called upon to criminalise piracy within their national laws and to detain and prosecute suspected pirates off the coast of Somalia in accordance with international human rights law. Progress made towards the implementation of the International Maritime Organization Djibouti Code of Conduct was praised, with the Council further calling upon participants to implement it fully as soon as possible.
